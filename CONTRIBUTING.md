### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build process)
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons)

### Examples

- `gui` - Frontend/UI changes
- `docker` - Docker/containerization
- `scripts` - Shell scripts
- `readme`, `docs` - Documentation

## 🔍 Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code follows our standards**:
   - Run ESLint and Prettier before committing
   - Code should be clean and well-commented where necessary
   - Test your changes locally with Docker

2. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README.md if you've added features or changed functionality
   - Add entry to CHANGELOG.md under `[Unreleased]` section
   - Update relevant documentation files in `docs/` if applicable

3. **Create a clear Pull Request**:
   - Use a descriptive title (following commit message format)
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Reference any related issues

4. **Code Review**:
   - All PRs require review before merging
   - Address review feedback promptly
   - Be open to discussion and suggestions

## 💻 Code Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting
- Run linting before committing:
  ```bash
  # In localcloud-gui/
  npm run lint
  ```

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for type safety

### API Endpoints
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Include proper error handling
- Return consistent response formats

### Shell Scripts
- POSIX-compliant (work on macOS, Linux, WSL)
- Include comments for complex logic
- Set executable permissions: `chmod +x script.sh`

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

While we don't have automated tests yet, please:

1. **Test locally** with Docker:
   ```bash
   make start
   # Test your changes in the GUI at http://localhost:3030
   ```

2. **Check core functionality**:
   - Can you create/delete resources?
   - Does the UI render correctly?
   - Are API endpoints responding as expected?

3. **Test across browsers** (for UI changes):
   - Chrome/Edge
   - Firefox
   - Safari (if on macOS)

4. **Verify Docker build** succeeds:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```
